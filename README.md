# Lucky Theme for VS Code
Sometimes programmers just need a little luck!
---

### Description
---
This is the culmination of my years of tweaking and adjusting VS Code to my own
personal preferences. My end goal is to have a clean purple and blue theme that
is pleasing to the eyes (mine at least).

### Installation
---
#### From the GitHub release page
All versions released will be posted under the releases section here on github,
install as you would any other packed extension for VSC.

#### From the VS Code Marketplace
Once finalized, I will be submitting the extension to the marketplace for ease
of installation, it is currently NOT available there.

### Contributing
---
#### Bugs/issues with the theme?
Something broken on a specific language? Create an
issue and I'll take a look! Feel free to provide a pull request if the fix is
known and I'll be happy to merge.

#### Not the theme for you?
This theme has been generated using
[my theme generator](https://github.com/AylaCodes/vscode-theme-generator)
which can be used to generate your own based on a simple provided color palette.
